A big shout out to [Sam Corder](https://twitter.com/SamCorder), [Alex Robinson](https://twitter.com/ajrobinson) and [Alex Argo](https://twitter.com/alexargo) (I'll catch you next time Argo).

I had the pleasure of talking to Sam and Alex on [SharedInstance episode 50](http://sharedinstance.com/50) about [ReSwift](https://github.com/ReSwift/ReSwift) and life.
I really appreciate the extended amount of time they both took to make it happen.

It turns out there is a lot of whitespace in my head when recording (problem with my mic?), so I highly recommend using smart speed in Overcast to anybody thinking about listening to the episode.
