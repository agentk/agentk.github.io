You may have noticed the interview series I have been working on: [Retro Speculative](https://loomstate.fm/retro/). They are very personal interviews with people involved in the Apple developer community.

> **But I need your help!**

I would really like to talk people in under-represented and quieter sections of the community. Including - but not limited to - **female developers** or **developers with disabilities**.

Tell your story, share your experiences, good and bad. What are you working on? What are you proud of? Tell the community what we can do to be more inclusive and welcoming.

> You don't have to have all the answers to be valued.

Are you interested in chatting? Who would you like to hear an interview with?
